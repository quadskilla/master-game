# Card Board Game Engine

This repository contains a very small proof-of-concept for a board card game engine written in HTML/JS. It provides a lobby with basic screens for Collection, Deck Building, Shop, Battle, Arena and an Admin panel that allows creation of new cards.

It is not a complete implementation of the described project, but a starting point that demonstrates how data can be stored in `localStorage` and rendered in a simple interface. All data (cards, packs, enemies, etc.) are stored on the browser side and can be modified through the admin panel.

To run the demo open `src/index.html` in a browser. Everything works locally without a server.

More features can be implemented by expanding the JavaScript code.
